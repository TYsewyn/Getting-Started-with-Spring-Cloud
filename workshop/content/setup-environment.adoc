During this workshop we will be using the command line as well as the embedded editor.
The editor takes a few moments to start up and be ready, so select the **Editor** tab now to display it, or click on the action block below.

[source,role=dashboard:open-dashboard]
----
name: Editor
----

The workshop uses these action blocks for various purposes.
Anytime you see such a block with an icon on the right hand side, you can click on it and it will perform the listed action for you.

Although we don't use it for the workshop, web console access is provided to the Kubernetes cluster using https://octant.dev/[Octant^].
To access Octant, select the **Console** tab. This will allow you to investigate further any deployments made to the cluster.
