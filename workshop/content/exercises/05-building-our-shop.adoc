We are now ready to build the application source code.
We will first do this direct into the local directory.

[source,bash,role=terminal:execute]
----
command: ./mvnw package
----

When the build has completed, build artefacts including the application JAR file, can be found in the `target` sub directory.

[source,bash,role=terminal:execute]
----
command: tree target
----

To test that the application works, run Java with the application JAR file:

[source,bash,role=terminal:execute]
----
command: java -jar target/shop-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

Because we added the `actuator` module as a dependency, a number of HTTP endpoints already exist.

To test the application and see what endpoints were added, run:

[source,bash,role=terminal:execute]
----
session: 2
command: curl -s localhost:8080/actuator | jq .
----

The output should be similar to the following:
....
{
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/actuator",
      "templated": false
    },
    "health": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/actuator/health",
      "templated": false
    },
    "health-path": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/{*path}",
      "templated": true
    },
    "info": {
      "href": "http://localhost:8080/actuator/info",
      "templated": false
    }
  }
}
....

We no longer need the local instance of the application, so you can kill it:

[source,bash,role=terminal:execute]
----
session: 1
command: <ctrl+c>
