Using this port forwarding trick we can easily access the running application.
However, the moment we want to add another functionality as a separate application we will not be able to use one IP address or DNS entry for two separate applications, or two Kubernetes services in this example.
In terms of functionality you could opt for a default Kubernetes `Ingress` which would allow you to route your traffic based on a (sub)path you want to access.
Unfortunately, the default Kubernetes `Ingress` doesn't support things like authentication, fail-over, rate limiting, and others.

This is where our next Spring Cloud project comes in: `Spring Cloud Gateway`.

Spring Cloud Gateway aims to provide a simple, yet effective way to route to APIs and provide cross cutting concerns to them such as: security, observability, and resiliency.
