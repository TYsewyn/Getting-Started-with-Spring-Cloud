Just like with our shop application we will need to create an image, push the image to our local registry and deploy our application onto our Kubernetes cluster.
Since we already went over this before, you can use the following commands:

[source,bash,role=terminal:execute]
----
command: |
  ./mvnw spring-boot:build-image -Dspring-boot.build-image.imageName={{ registry_host }}/springguides/gateway
  docker push {{ registry_host }}/springguides/gateway
  kubectl create deployment gateway --port=8080 --image={{ registry_host }}/springguides/gateway
  kubectl expose deployment gateway --name my-gateway --port 80 --target-port 8080
----

Because we already went ahead and made the gateway accessible from outside the cluster you should not use the port forwarding trick anymore.
Execute the next command to check if our `orders` route is working as expected.

[source,bash,role=terminal:execute]
----
command: "curl -sSL -D - -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" {{ ingress_protocol }}://{{ session_namespace }}-gateway.{{ ingress_domain }}/orders"
----

You should an output similar to:

....
